# Logistic_Regression
Predict how likely it is that the people will take an H1N1 flu vaccine using Logistic  Regression.

## Abstract
This study aims to predict the likelihood of receiving an H1N1 flu vaccine using logistic regression. The data for this study includes demographic information such as age, gender, and occupation, as well as information on the individual's previous vaccination history and their perceptions towards vaccines. 

## Problem Statement
The goal is to predict how likely it is that the people will take an H1N1 flu vaccine using Logistic Regression.

## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn’t vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1. In logistic regression, a logit transformation is applied on the odds—that is, the probability of success divided by the probability of failure. This is also commonly known as the log odds, or the natural logarithm of odds, and this logistic function is represented by the following formulas:

$$
L(y, \hat{y}) = -y \log(\hat{y}) - (1 - y) \log(1 - \hat{y})
$$

where,<br><br> $y$ : true label <br><br>
$\hat{y}$ : predicted probability of the sample being of class 1 <br><br>$L$ : loss function</p>
